# Qt5 and CMake Practise

This repository contains the exercises of popular Qt5 Gui tutorials but instead of using the build system shown in the tutorials it's using CMake as a build system. 

Currently this repository contains:

* [Qtwiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Beginners) Qt Beginner exercises (not organized at all | don't look at this :))
* [zetcode.com](http://zetcode.com/gui/qt5/) Qt5 Tutorial exercises (zet_# folders)
